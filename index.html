            <h2>Bugun Liocichla and Bugun People</h2>
            <p>
                Only about 20 pairs of the Bugun Liocichla and around 2000 members of the
                Bugun tribe, a language group, exist today. The bird, named after the
                Bugun tribe, is found in their community reserve. Its discovery and the
                conservation of the immensely biodiverse ecosphere called the Eagle Nest
                Sanctuary where it thrives is the story of the encounter of Nature and
                Modern life, of depletion and conservation through Scientific Research,
                Community Participation and Policy. The Brai Dua Clan of the Bugun have
                donated 2 sq kms of their land for conservation and research, making the
                location an eco tourism destination. The Goh Bugun Project could become
                beneficial for the Bugun community.
            </p>
            <p>
                But for the 2000 Bugun people who live in 11 villages in the West Kameng
                district of Arunachal Pradesh, their language is in peril and their heritage
                is rapidly fading into modernity. To take advantage of science, conservation,
                new markets and modern infrastructure, they need a strong knowledge base
                rooted in their own cultural experience of living and making. The loss of a
                language and a living culture becomes a loss to global cultural diversity.

                The Goh Bugun Project is about Reviving Bugun Heritage crafts and creating
                confidence in their knowledge of making, so that crafting as a culture, an
                avenue for entrepreneurship and livelihood may emerge in future. Imagining
                Community futures through Culturally Rooted Knowledge and Sustainable
                Livelihoods

            <h3>The 4Rs Strategy</h3>
            <p>
                Most tribal communities in Arunachal Pradesh have a basic knowledge of agriculture, horticulture, house building, bamboo construction, weaving cloth, and making cane and bamboo products. Cultural knowledge, craft, and design are significant parts of cultural identity which can easily find a place in modern life. We have created a 4Rs strategy to address this possibility in the gentlest and most sustainable manner.
